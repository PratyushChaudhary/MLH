# MLH Playground

This is my personal playground for everything I try out during MLH events.  
Mostly experiments, learning projects, and random hacks.

## About

Right now it’s just my first Global Hack Week project — more will come as I keep exploring.

Nothing here is meant to be super polished. It’s all for learning, testing, and having some fun with new tech.

## Thanks

Big shoutout to MLH for giving students like me a reason to explore and build.
